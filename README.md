VRATS - Virtual Reality Army Training Simulator

VRATS was a virtual reality-based training simulator designed to help users improve their shooting skills using a .21 rifle. Developed at Parallax Labs, the project focused on providing an immersive training environment with three different maps, each offering unique shooting challenges:

Shooting Range – A static target shooting environment where users could set targets at different distances (close, medium, or long). A test mode allowed users to fire five bullets to assess their accuracy.

Moving Target – A dynamic shooting scenario where targets moved across the range, requiring players to adjust their aim and timing. A test mode was also included for skill evaluation.

Balloon Shoot – A reflex-based challenge where users had to shoot balloons, with each successful hit triggering a new balloon at a different location.
